# Guessing-Game

Hey, I had developed/engineered a new Mini-Project which is a Guessing game.

I developed this using frontend technologies: HTML & Javascript.

This game asks the user to enter a maximum number in a range, then generates a random number(internally) between 1 and the max number, and asks the user to guess the random number. If the user's guess is wrong, then it gives a hint to the user and the game continues again.
The game/program only stops when the user enters 'exit' as input or if the user's guess is right.
